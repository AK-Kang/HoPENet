# HoPENet
This project is a resource website targets at organizations, volunteers, and people in-need and connects them around the topic of homelessness. 
It provides each with the resources to meet their needs and creates a collaborative environment. 
It has 2 functions: one to predict homelessness statistics based on counties, and the other to predict an individual's risk of becoming homeless.
